[x] add in text using the bebe nue font
[x] add in at one to two new level types
[x] add in sky component

- vertical spikes on square that slam down(almost like the angry blocks in super mario)
- horizontal spikes that move back and forth
- windmill trap just like spinner

[x] add cool home screen. Which will have a few clouds to conceal the background and 3D text of the new game title
[x] clouds will move away from each other like curtains and the text will fade out as the camera moves to the game

[] create leaderboard and use firestore or realtime db to store all scores under a user so need to set basic auth form with firebase

[] add a piece of logic that will allow for a trap to contain more than one trap potentially

[x] for the configurator, might just have it sitting to the right of the screen,
and when a user click the style icon it just moves the camera to the right and the ball will move as well. Just will have basic configurator settings like color and maybe a few decal options

[x] add certain sound effects that trigger when you get near traps

[] for axe trap, replace basic square with actual model of axe

[] utilize mesh portal material to allow for different game environments

[x] look into cool environment maps to add nice highlights to player
